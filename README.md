# Hangman

A Hangman game implemented in Python can be found in `hangman.py`. You can start the game with the following command:
```
python hangman.py
```
Make sure to use Python 3[.5.1] for this code (if you would like the code in Python 2, just let me know and I can modify the relevant methods).

Once started, you have the ability to input your own word, or let the game choose a word for you from a predefined list of words. You can also specify the number of lives (which defaults to 6). Note that this game also allows any characters to be used in your game, not just English characters.
